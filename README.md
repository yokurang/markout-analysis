## Market Data & Trade Analysis Challenge

This submission contains the `main.ipynb` file which contains all of the Python code used to generate my outputs and analysis. The notebook first performs an EDA of the data to make sure that the data is prepared for analysis. Then, the notebook, for each instrument, plots an interesting one-hour period of the market and trade data and the aggregate overall markout curves. Finally, the notebook answers the questions posed in the challenge, investigating whether the strategy is a maker or taker, some interesting characteristics of the strategy from its post-trade profile, and the strategy's maximum drawdown and when it occurred.

Please remember to create a virtual environment and set it up with the Jupyter notebook kernel to install the necessary packages and run the notebook.

Furthermore, a `report.pdf` can be found in the `report` directory. This report contains a summary answering the questions posed in the challenge. For more detailed analysis and results, please refer to the Jupyter notebook.

Note that the horizon intervals are contained in the `horizon_ticks` file, and the data for this challenge is saved in the `data` folder. A full description of the challenge can be found in the `instructions.txt` file.
