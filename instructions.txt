===[ Assignment ]===

GMMAUSD, LMDAUSD, ZTAUSD, BTAUSD are four hypothetical instruments. For each instrument,
you are given:
* some metadata (<instrument>.json) <OK>
* top-of-book market data (<instrument>_md.csv) <OK>
* a set of trades (<instrument>_trades.csv). <OK>

You are also provided a list of intervals in millisecond units (horizon_ticks). <OK>

For each instrument, you are to deliver the following:
    * A plot visualizing both the market data and the trades, for an interesting 1 hour period of your choice.
    * A plot visualizing the aggregate markout curve of all trades for the symbol, using the intervals specified
      in the file "horizon_ticks". Please ensure your curve shows "margin" - i.e. PNL normalized by volume.
	  * For example, if the file horizon_ticks contained the following intervals: [0, 100, 200], the pnl-markout curve 
	    for a trade dealt at time t would show 3 datapoints: the PNL of the trade at time t, t+100ms, t+200ms. 
	    The overall markout curve can then be transformed to show _margin_ rather than PNL by normalizing the datapoints 
	    by the trade size.
      * The above describes computing a curve for a single trade, we are looking for you to 
        compute an aggregate curve incorporating all trades, showing overall margin at each interval.
          
    * Answers to the following questions:
        * Assuming all trades for this instrument were executed by a single strategy, and the sides of the trades are from
          the perspective of said strategy, is the strategy a maker or a taker?
        * Can you deduce any other interesting characteristics of the strategy, from its post-trade profile?
        * Assuming the day was started with no position, what was the maximum drawdown experienced by the strategy
          for the period covered by the market data, and at which timestamp did this occur? 
          Please compute drawdown from mark-to-market PNL.
          
        NOTE: Please keep your answers to a maximum of a few lines.


Please provide all python code used to generate the output, 
and your answers to the above questions in a suitable format (.pdf preferred for the latter).
